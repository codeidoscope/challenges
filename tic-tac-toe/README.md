# Tic Tac Toe - Rust

I was originally hoping to write this Tic Tac Toe in Go or in Elixir, but
eventually settled for Rust as it is a language that I believe will take me
very far out of my comfort zone. It is also a good way for me to test my mettle
and see how I cope with ramping up on such a language in such a short amount of
time.

## Requirements
- Rust - I use `rustc 1.33.0 (2aa4c46cf 2019-02-28)` on this project, and I
followed the installation instructions given on the
[Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Features
- [ ] Human player (X)
- [ ] Unbeatable Computer player (O)
- [ ] Input validation
