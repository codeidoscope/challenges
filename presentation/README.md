# Presentation

As I explore the topic of my choosing and build my presentation, I will be
making notes and keeping track of resources used.

### notes

You will find lists of ideas, quotes, drafts that I think may be useful for my
presentation. These are in their roughest form and will merely help you follow
my processes of research and implementation.
