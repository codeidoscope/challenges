## Introduction
- What I used to do before I was a developer, wanting to be a spy, working as a cyber intelligence analyst
- What I want to address in this presentation
  - What kind of data can be collected about us on the internet
  - What it’s used for
  - What is the impact
  - What can we do to improve this
- Why it matters to me

## I - Social engineering
- Ask audience what’s the weirdest or funniest thing they discovered about themselves or someone else online
- Explain what the process is to build someone’s profile from data available online
  - Start with a name and a workplace, sometimes photo
  - Look through social media, Facebook, LinkedIn
  - Run Google searches with keywords, i.e. university or job, etc
  - Look at other people who may be close to them
- Discuss the types of sources it’s possible to gather data from
  - Electoral records, 192.com, birth/marriage records, genealogy websites, aggregators, etc.
- What a “bad” online presence would look like
  - Use DR’s example: Where/when he met his wife, where they got married and spent their first night together, where he lives, what bus he takes
- Show a demo?

## II - Data collected by companies
- Google, FB, Tinder -> What do they gather and what does that look like
- “Surveillance” -> Alexa, Google Home, Instagram using microphone, Google Phone listening in
- The government and the kind of data they’re allowed to collect
- Why metadata isn’t as innocent as it might seem

## III - What is the data used for
- Advertisement
- FB estimating your salary and age even if you don’t provide that info to target more affluent groups
- UX tracking
- Cambridge Analytica

## IV - So what’s so bad about it?
- Convenience VS privacy -> If you’re not paying, you’re the product
- Security VS privacy -> They’re not side of the same coin
- Why being anonymous sucks
  - Algorithms are biased and do not take individual cases into account
  - You’re never truly anonymous and your data can be linked back to you
- How you can be directly affected
  - Equifax, mortgage refused
  - Lever, incorrectly linking accounts to your profile
- It’s a bit creepy…

## V - How can you protect yourself online?
- Become invisible
- Become “blurry”
- Using different pseudonyms, different email addresses, hiding fake keywords on site (SEO)

## Conclusion
