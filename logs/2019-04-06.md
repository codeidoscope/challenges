## To investigate

-----

## Learned today
- The formatting of my tiles was far easier to refactor than I expected. I had
to change the test assertions and the formatting in the logic, but I expected
the changes to be more complex than they ended up being.

-----

## Done today
- [x] Update formatting
- [x] Display status messages for game outcome
- [x] Display position played at by player

-----

## Plan for tomorrow
- [ ] Implement validation for position already occupied
- [ ] Minimax
