# Codelog #9 - 2019-04-07

-----

## Plan for the day
- [ ] Implement validation for position already occupied
- [ ] Minimax

-----

## To investigate

-----

## Learned today
- It's possible to use `()` as the return value of an if/else statement if the
`else` does not need to return anything.
- `'attempt to subtract with overflow'` came from the fact that I was giving my
function the index of the iterator (i.e. `0`), but thought I was giving the
user-facing number of the tile (i.e. `1`), and trying to subtract 1 from 0, which
it wouldn't accept.

-----

## Done today
- [x] Return a list of empty tiles' positions
- [x] Extract `game_rules` out of `game`

-----

## Plan for tomorrow
- [ ] Minimax
