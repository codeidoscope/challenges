# Codelog #3 - 2019-04-01

-----

## Plan for the day
- [ ] Refactor board from vector to vector of structs (or types)
- [ ] Add input validation for position choice
- [ ] Define rules for winning

-----

## To investigate
- Get a better understanding of closures and `move`

-----

## Learned today
- I can go more functional than expected
- Splitting vectors is painful, don't do it

-----

## Done today
- [x] Refactor board from vector to vector of structs (or types)
- [x] Get rows, columns and diagonals

-----

## Plan for tomorrow
- [ ] Add input validation for position choice
- [ ] Define rules for winning
