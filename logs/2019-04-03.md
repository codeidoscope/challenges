# Codelog #5 - 2019-04-03

-----

## Plan for the day
- [ ] Check if position is occupied
- [ ] Mark board with symbol
- [ ] Swap two players
- [ ] Create game loop
- [ ] Define rules for winning

-----

## To investigate

-----

## Learned today
- Interior mutability
- If you return an object by value (i.e. return `Self`), the caller will have
ownership of it and can mutate it. This contrasts with returning something by
reference.
- `mem::swap` is the safe way to swap two fields, as you can't move a field
out of a reference to self to store it in a temporary without using `unsafe`
 stuff
