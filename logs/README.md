# Logs

Everyday, I start a log to record my plans for the day, the problems I faced,
the solutions I found to solve them, interesting questions I would like to
explore, and the resources I used during the day or plan on using the next day.

These logs help me keep track of my achievements, the problems I faced and their
solutions, and acts as a repository of knowledge and resources. It is also a
way for me to stay accountable and stay on track.

The format is always the same:

```
# Codelog #X - XXXX-XX-XX

-----

## Plan for the day

-----

## To investigate

-----

## Learned today

-----

## Done today

-----

## Plan for tomorrow

-----

## Resource list
```
