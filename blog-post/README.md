# Blog post

## Choice of post
I chose to rewrite
[this post](https://medium.com/@codeidoscope/progr-argh-ming-fe3570686431).
It discusses my relationship to programming, the struggles I encountered, why
I encountered those struggles, and finally, some strategies that I put in
place to help me tackle those struggles.

The original post is very long (3000+ words) and I ramble on quite a lot, so
it was a good candidate for a revisit. Since I wrote it in December, I have
grown as a developer I now have a few points I can expand and improve on.


##Â Changes made
- I am shortening this article to around 1000 words, which gives me space
to discuss strategies, but forces me to keep the rambling at bay.

- I am rethinking the strategies that I talk about, and adding details that are
more technically centred.

- I am also making it less personal, so that it can be relatable to more people,
which I believe will make it easier to read and enjoy.

- Finally, although I did love my title, it needs to go in favour of something
that makes it clearer what the point of the article is.
