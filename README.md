# Marion's Challenges

This repository is currently private and accessible to everyone with permission
to view it and interact with it. It contains materials for the blog post and
the presentation, as well as the Tic Tac Toe.

## blog-post
You will find the original post, including a link to the version first published
to Medium, as well as the proposed new version. The folder includes a README
file that explains why I selected this article and the changes I've made to it.

## logs
Although this is for my own use, you will be able to find the logs I recorded
for what I planned on doing and what I achieved each day that I worked on the
challenges.

## presentation
You will find notes taken during the process of preparing the presentation,
a bibliography of sources I have used for the presentation, as well as a
transcript of the presentation itself.

## tic-tac-toe
You will find the codebase for a Human VS Unbeatable Computer game of
Tic Tac Toe written in Rust. In order to see the code, please switch to
the `tic-tac-toe` branch of this repository. Please refer to the README file
for setting it up and playing the game.
